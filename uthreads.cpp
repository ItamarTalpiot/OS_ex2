/**
 * @brief initializes the thread library.
 *
 * Once this function returns, the main thread (tid == 0) will be set as RUNNING. There is no need to
 * provide an entry_point or to create a stack for the main thread - it will be using the "regular" stack and PC.
 * You may assume that this function is called before any other thread library function, and that it is called
 * exactly once.
 * The input to the function is the length of a quantum in micro-seconds.
 * It is an error to call this function with non-positive quantum_usecs.
 *
 * @return On success, return 0. On failure, return -1.
